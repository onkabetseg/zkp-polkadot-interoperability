# ZKP-Polkadot-Interoperability

Prototype for a **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) based solution** to enhance secure and scalable blockchain interoperability in the **Polkadot** ecosystem.

## 📦 Project Overview

Most blockchains struggle to communicate securely due to privacy risks, weak trust models, and lack of common technical standards. This project explores how **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** can help solve these problems by allowing blockchains to verify information without revealing sensitive data.

The prototype focuses on building and testing a ZKP-based model to improve secure cross-chain communication within Polkadot.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- ZKP-based verification for cross-chain message passing  
- Secure and privacy-preserving transaction validation  
- Prototype implemented using Substrate, Circom or ZoKrates  
- Simulated test environment for performance and security testing
